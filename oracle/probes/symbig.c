/*
 * The symbolic faces above forty pixels per em.
 *
 * `glyphs` draws Symbol at every height from eight to forty and Wingdings not
 * at all -- it is in the corpus only through the metrics probes and the
 * installer one. Neither has ever been drawn above forty.
 *
 * They are worth asking separately from the text faces. A symbolic face is
 * mapped by name rather than by charset, its glyphs are shapes no letter
 * resembles -- solid discs, arrows, a hand -- and Symbol is the face installed
 * twice, with a strike of its own beside the outline, which is a choice the
 * mapper has to make at every size.
 *
 * Same sweep and same record as `plotbig`, so the same adapter replays it.
