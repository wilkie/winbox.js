summary: Closes a waveform input device: the driver asked, and the handle let go only if it agrees.

## Observed behaviour

- [[measured]] [[probe:mmnodev]], on the installation with no sound driver and on the one with the Sound Blaster: a handle that is no device's -- 1234h, or nought -- answers `MMSYSERR_INVALHANDLE` (5), before anything else is looked at.

## Inside Windows

- [[read out]] `MMSYSTEM.DLL` seg3: the handle is checked to be a waveform input device's (seg1 `1e8`), then `WIDM_CLOSE` (35h) goes to the driver; the handle is freed only on its answer of nought.

## Implementation

As read out: `crates/winbox-win16/src/mmsystem/wave.rs`, over the device layer of `crates/winbox-win16/src/mmsystem/devices.rs`.
