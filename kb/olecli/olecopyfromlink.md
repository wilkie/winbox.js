## Observed behaviour

- [[measured]] [[probe:olestat]]: with document nought, `OLE_ERROR_HANDLE` before the object is asked; [[probe:olemem]]: the method itself answers `OLE_ERROR_STATIC`.

## Nuances

- [[measured]] [[probe:oledde]], [[probe:olepbd]], [[probe:olepbr]]: an embedded or linked object -- `StdFileEditing`, a server talked to by DDE -- is WinBox's own, with `OLECLI.DLL` on the drive and without it: its `LE` method answers ([[topic:ole]], "Embedded and linked objects").

## Implementation

WinBox's own: `OleCopyFromLink` in `crates/winbox-win16/src/olecli/api.rs`, written from the interface and the probes, not from the code of `OLECLI.DLL` ([[topic:ole]]). WinBox agrees with [[probe:olestat]], [[probe:olemem]], [[probe:oledde]], [[probe:olepbd]] and [[probe:olepbr]], with `OLECLI.DLL` on the drive and without it (`crates/winbox-win16/tests/olecli.rs`).
