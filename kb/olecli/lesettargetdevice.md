## Observed behaviour

- [[measured]] [[probe:oledde]], [[probe:olepbd]]: The block's bytes kept; open, poked as `StdTargetDevice`, released `OLE_OTHER`.

## Implementation

WinBox's own: `linked.ts`'s `LE_METHODS` and `crates/winbox-win16/src/olecli/linked.rs`'s `method`, written from OLE 1.0's documented protocol and the probes, not from the code of `OLECLI.DLL` ([[topic:ole]], "Embedded and linked objects").
